# Ghibli-style Trees Example in React Js

![img_tree](doc/img_1.png)

This project is developed in order to learn new tools to help me improve my skills as a front-end developer.

We make use of:
- [React js](https://react.dev/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [React ThreeFiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- [@create-three/drei](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-three/drei)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
